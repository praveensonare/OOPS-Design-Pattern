Problem Statement
Test 1. Visitor

Create an interface or abstract base class 'Shape'.
Implement three concrete Shapes: 'Circle', 'Rectangle', 'Triangle'.
Apply the visitor pattern to your data model.
Write an AreaVisitor that computes the area of the shapes.
Write a program that makes arbitrary instances of the data model and applies the AreaVisitor.

Solution
****************************************************************
Running The Project from Terminal
1. Go to VisitorPattern Directory 
2. Execute command "run.sh" script file.
   Example : >> sh run.sh

It will run the program displaying area of various shapes using AreaVisitor.
Some scenarios of I have added in main.cpp
